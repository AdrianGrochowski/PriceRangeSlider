# PriceRangeSlider

PriceRangeSlider was created in order to use plain JavaScript on website without unecessery libraries. Moreover it was a good training to learn using classes in JavaScript in order to have clean, well organised and optimised code. 

Slider fits to the container that is passed to the function as a variable.
