# PriceRangeSlider

PriceRangeSlider was created in order to use plain JavaScript on website without unecessery libraries. Moreover it was a good training to learn using classes in JavaScript in order to have clean, well organised and optimised code. 

Slider fits to the container that is passed to the function as a parameter.
List of parameters to pass to constructor: minimum value, maximum value, id of the minimum input as well as the id of the maximum input, in the end we pass the id of the container the slider should inject.
